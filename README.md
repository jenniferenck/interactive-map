This project utilizes D3 for the map creation, visuals and interactivity

I used scripts from the following link as my starter code to get a map up and running quickly: 
https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/choropleth_basic.html

What this map should do: 

1) Display the world map and highlight countries that we want to have interactivity (relevant countries)

2) On highlighted-country hover, a pop-out of information regarding the # of artisans that the company works with is listed with links to get more information

3) The clickable links will redirect to artisan pages with more information
